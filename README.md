# MacOS Effort for Xiaomi Mi Notebook & Gaming laptops
The project goal is to develop and maintain MacOS support for all Xiaomi Notebook (Air / Pro) & Gaming Laptop series.

## Currently Supported devices
- Mi-NB-Air-125-7y30

## Instalation instructions
The EFI builds  are APCI hotpatch based. Meaning your DSDT is patched via SSDT files loaded in `/EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched` which improves the compatibility between laptops within the series. Additional install instructions will be added together with Clover instructions.

## Current release
v0.1-beta.1 - [View the release page](https://github.com/influenist/Mi-NB-Gaming-Laptop-MacOS/releases)
